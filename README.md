**Introduction**    
Cancer accounted for 8.8 million deaths globally in 2015 and was the second most common cause of death in the world. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most frequently diagnosed cancer in Spain for both men and women with over 41,441 new cases in 2015. Besides clinical and pathological characteristics of the tumor, also general health status and comorbidities can influence cancer treatment and outcomes. Comorbidity and multimorbidity are increasingly seen as a problem of the elderly. A number of studies have been performed analysing the influence of comorbidity on cancer outcomes, but little evidence is available regarding the frequency and distribution of comorbidities at a population level among CRC patients in Spain.  
**Methods**      
We developed a population-based high-resolution cohort study, including all CRC incident cases diagnosed in 2011 (n= 1,061). Data were drawn from two population cancer registries and patient’s medical records. We defined comorbidity as the existence of a long-term health condition or disorder in the presence of cancer, whereas multimorbidity refers to the existence of two or more comorbid conditions. We described the frequency and distribution of comorbidities and multimorbidity by patient, tumor and healthcare factors using radar-plots and heat-maps. Then, we used generalized linear models to characterize the risk factors associated with the presence of the most prevalent comorbidities plus dementia and multimorbidity. We used forest plots to display the results. Finally, we developed an interactive web application http://watzilei.com/shiny/CoMCoR/ and a GitHub repository https://github.com/migariane/CoMCoR for reproducibility and allowing the complete visualization of the study results.      
**Results**  
The most common comorbidities were diabetes (23.6%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (17.2%) and congestive heart failure (14.5%). Dementia was the most common comorbidity among older patients (75+ years) showing a higher proportion (30%) of late cancer diagnosis (stage IV) and hospital emergency admission (33%). CRC with dementia had nearly three times higher risk of not being offered surgery treatment (RR: 2.8, 95%CI: 1.6, 5.0). Older (+75 years) obese male and current smoker, late surgery after cancer diagnosis (more than 60 days) and not being offered a surgical treatment were associated with a higher risk of multimorbidity. Patients with multimorbidity (2 or more comorbidities) aged 75+ years showed a higher prevalence of surgery the same day or the day after hospital emergency admission (37%).     
**Conclusion**  
CoMCoR found a relevant pattern in the distribution and frequency of comorbidities and multimorbidity among CRC patients in Spain mostly associated with dementia, advanced age and surgical treatment. CRC frequency of late diagnosis (stage IV) among patients with dementia and the high proportion of older patients not being offered surgical treatment are important findings that require policy actions. All the results from CoMCoR are made open source available in a web application which is meant to serve as a scientific tool supporting evidence-based policymaking aiming to improve comorbid CRC patients' outcomes.
